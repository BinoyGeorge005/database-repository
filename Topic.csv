KSID,Translated Recommend Reason
K001055435,Hard to get technical support
K001051608,Response are not done in timely manner.
K001057278,Service experience is very poor. Two months for repairing equipment is too much.
K001049444,"Not sure what exactly Keysight does? No contact with procurement, only feedback from demand side"
K001059171,We have an equipment in repair that due to circumstances has been out of the facilities for almost four months
K001053962,"I have request quotes through the Keysight website and do not receive a reply. Reliability poor compounded by lack of spares support for customer in house cal labs, leading to long periods of downtime of equipment due to it having to be returned to Keysight for expensive repairs. Not being able to individual return boards for repair/exchange. Tech support do not have the know-how to assist in the diagnosis of faults just respond with `return to Keysight for repair`. The TME calibration software could be more adaptable regarding the required test equipment standards required for the test protocols, which is lacking compared to rival software."
K001052837,We have recently acquired keysight equipment >300k$ and have experienced very poor technical support. We discovered severe problems with top-line AWG and digitizer products and found that keysight is unable to fix them properly.
K001049187,New solution and customer have to suffer the bugs while paying full price for the solution
K001053150,"Benchvue interface is clunky, unintuitive and hard to use. Moreover, it is hard to find a manual for it. Am looking for other vendor's DAQs."
K001055777,It is unfortunate that there is no support for discontinued Keysight products.
K001052405,We would benefit from more onsite support and faster turn around times between questions asked to the applications engineer and answers received. Current turn around times are about 2 weeks which is far to slow.
K001052416,The emails are a little excessive.
K001052954,Functions that allow you to perform the necessary measurements
K001050770,"The communication could be better, they were good, but it seems that keysight is changing their way of working?"
K001056597,For service I think they are very nonresponsive.
K001059270,Keysight india support and expertise poor
K001062477,"Dissatisfaction with customer service support due to changes in KEYSIGHT policy in recent years. Maximizing profits is a company&#39;s goal, but it seems unlikely that there will be a company that customers turn away from. I hope that KEYSIGHT will develop further by maintaining balance. If there are alternative suppliers or dealers, users who lack purchasing power will seek out alternative equipment."
K001052450,Your customer support is too slow for academia. Your prices have increased by too much compared to the rest of the market. You tend to charge for your support e.g. simple python scripts charged 5k while other company offer this for free. Furthermore the software provided is contiuously bugging but no one care to solve the problem. And the documentation is extremely poorly written
K001049683,Tools 8-9 Prices 6 Software licensing 0-1 Customer tech support 1-2
K001060941,Last item purchased was defective.   It took several months to resolve due to Keysight's poor support.
K001059289,"Commitment to Delivery Period was 4 weeks but delivered after 4 months and the equipment delivery was partial only and not cross verified with our PO BOQ before shipment. Third party equipment delivery has taken more time even beyond 6 months. Required frequency wasn't met for delivered antennas and the correct frequency antenna took another few months to deliver. Laptop was delivered with 500GB SSD, but actual PO BOQ was 1TB SSD."
K001058475,Too many DELAYS
K001051793,"The equipment is quality, the support is ok, got a visit from your rep here and he said some information about support that have not been backed up.  He said there were power supply's for the DSO and MSO scope that might be available, I have two here at the University that are in need.  I followed up with an email later but no response."
K001052539,Product for PCIe AER injections does not meet our test requirements presently.
K001050201,The EEsof Genesys Support email address changes regularly and it is difficult to find my account online
K001056040,"The support by Mr. Kuenstler was exemplary regarding accessibility and knowledge. The warehouse of the company is a disgrace, several times we waited over two weeks for a remote computer because the warehouse forgot to send the goods."
K001061923,"No repair, but complete change of calibrated devices which had a minor errors, which led to multiple problems in an accredited test laboratory."
K001054310,"It seems that the response to technical inquiries is too late. They show a lot of interest and respond quickly when renting or re-leasing a tool, but it may be because they are busy, but after that, there doesn&#39;t seem to be any progress even if you inquire. I hope that we can provide speedy technical support to our customers."
K001058182,Bad license agreement.
K001060684,The cost of repair was more than 70% of the cost of the whole device when the fault is one board out of more than 5 in the system.
K001061580,Kontaktieren sie mich bitte nur auf deutsch. Bestellung eines Gerätes könnte schlechter nicht sein. Reparatur zu teuer oder auf Grund von Umsatz unterbunden ich muss mich proaktiv um meine Bestellung kümmern. mehr als ein Ansprechpartner. Lieferzeit vollkommen inakzeptabel.
K001055294,"Customer service representative was rude, provided no updates on classes I was registered for. First was cancelled with almost no notice and no previous notification was given that the class wasn't confirmed with our order. When I did get into class, apparently the customer service rep had complained about my correspondence because the instructor made a point to tell me that they would have cancelled it if I hadn't been pushy. I wasn't pushy, just requesting information and noting that providing information would be better customer service."
K001049096,"Recently, even if planned, a pna upgrade is requiring more than three months… and a clear delivery date has not been provided, yet"
K001062972,Things are easy to break and it is difficult to contact the business. It may be that one person has too much business and cannot provide timely support.
K001059616,"Short term life span on expensive products sold. Difficulty in trying to get a resolution. Resolution provided puts most of the issues back on the customer. Sales want to sell more licenses for product that's been made end of life, does it make sense to purchase the licenses? Feel that the NEMO product is getting further behind the competition. Some lack of keeping up with customer requirements or industry changes. Difficulty in communicating, hard to get information or responses on product development and improvements or requirements going forward, going via technical support process is just an impedance in most cases."
K001061610,"Keysight experience is just a sign of the times, nothing like when it was HP back in the 80's-90's.   It lost its technical and service superiority, today there are other alternatives that can do the same or better."
K001062523,need more customer service!
K001057067,"Benchvue off-line installation was extremely hard, took several weeks.  Being DoD I can't access the enormous files required.  There should be another option."
K001060881,Hi  I called your distributor and wanted to know answers about volume software licensing costs which are considerable. I needed this information in order make a deadline for a sanction to get purchase approval. Sadly the information was not available in time and the budget was not approved. Instead I had to renew the license for National Instruments Teststand instead. Keysight should release that business opportunities are lost when information was not published.
K001057063,"I am not satisfied with speed of any feedback from Keysight, when I need a quotation, make decision..."
K001061643,delivery time was exceeeded by months (!) without any information / update.
K001057860,"have the time we receive scopes from Keysight, they are non-operational / DOA. Even after a simple job like calibration. You need to find out either how to better package scopes during shipping, or do a better job confirming working scope before it leaves your facility, or both"
K001053713,Poor customer service compared to other companies
K001057977,"I thought they responded quickly and were courteous. Manufacturers generally charge a lot of money, so I would be happy if I could receive some special benefits or discounts. In addition, especially when making repairs, it would be helpful if you could receive a consultation over the phone before diagnosing the actual machine."
K001061257,Price is high
K001063068,"When I contacted them to say that the possibility of purchasing had decreased, they blatantly stopped responding to my inquiries."
K001055622,"This is not because of the original measurement function (ability), but because there is a bug in the application such as function switching. Sometimes I do a factory reset to get it back on track."
K001054096,"I am unable to sign a repair/calibration contract for the calibration kit I recently purchased. (Calibration contract only) The products I have purchased so far come with a repair/calibration contract, but the contract fee for just the calibration contract is higher than the previous repair/calibration contract. Even when I asked them why they couldn&#39;t make a repair contract or why the price was set so high, they wouldn&#39;t give me an answer. ``That&#39;s the way it is&#39;&#39; and they won&#39;t tell me the reason, so I can&#39;t move forward with signing a contract."
K001060535,"The quality is good, but the price is soaring"
K001063021,"If you have questions about measurement problems, you will no longer be able to receive answers from your company unless you subscribe to technical support."
K001053810,There are currently no plans to introduce expensive general-purpose measuring instruments.
K001057673,"It depends on the product, but the price is higher than other manufacturers."
K001053534,"The price cannot be said to be recommended. However, I would recommend it for support etc."
K001049525,The response to all after-sales services is too administrative.
K001057884,The reception desk is overseas and the actual work is difficult to communicate within Japan.
K001053691,"Balance between product quality and follow-up. Even if the quality is good, it is clear that if there is no manual or support page, you will be in trouble later."
K001055752,"Even though we managed to get approval for the repair cost, which was about 2 million yen, and ordered the repair, it is not normal for the product to be repaired and calibrated and returned in the same broken condition as before the repair. This means that the calibration data is completely unreliable. There is no way you can get calibration data that shows normality even though it is broken. (The person who dealt with it was someone else, but even when I had previously dealt with a repaired product, they were made to go through unnecessary trouble, and I think this is a situation that would never have been possible at Agilent in the past, when Mr. Saeki was in charge of sales.) )"
K001063043,"Technical Support The quality of support is good, but I gave the above rating because Keysight Care is charged."
K001061432,Because the support is not good
K001061200,"There are no problems with quality or service. I don&#39;t think it can be helped, but I&#39;m lowering my rating a little because of the price."
K001056011,"E5061B is the best. But it&#39;s expensive, so I can&#39;t buy it even if it&#39;s recommended inside or outside the company. Samples of programs that were previously available for free are now available for purchase. I would like to see a change in the balance of charging, such as providing it to registered members and making the code publicly available."
K001057119,"I purchased the product because I thought it was great, but after purchasing it, there was something strange about the KeysightCare subscription (when purchasing a new product). Although I am not denying its performance, there are problems with experience and cost as mentioned above, so if it is possible to replace it, I will evaluate and consider other companies."
K001051614,"Due to only using Keysight once a year, we cannot set up account and paying is a pain. Came to pick up device without informing us of pick-up date. Took time to identify why delay in getting device back."
K001050872,"I had 9 items for calibration, all but 1 Keysight Cal before. I had call about getting the the first 5 quotes, where were they, what's the delay. Call about the P-Card payment, I told them I had 4 other quotes being proccessed, could they please apply the same payment, I was told I was all set. I was then told 2 items couldn't be calibrated, what? Called again, it was fixed. The status was they were being resceduled?? Found out the were waiting for payment, but I was all set? Guess not, wish I had known, and more delays. Communication sucked! I have never had so many problems with quotes, calibrations and payments before."
K001059811,I have requested information on Keysight equipment but never received information.  Whil working as a Scientist at SwRI I had Keysight make a signal mixer for 1M.  The mixer did not meet the requirements we had agreed on during the critical design review.
K001049354,too long response time
K001061793,"We are a small-ish startup, which means that we are very cost-conscious and driven to move quickly. My recent experiences with Keysight pricing and leadtimes just haven't been a very good fit."
K001054048,"Bench vue subscriptions for little older devices.. No way Bugs in firmware 34465A.. Keysight knows the problem but no fix in few years.  Older devices.. drivers are not OK in the newest windows 11  Etc etc.. it is a long way to old good HP times when the software was top quality.  Very bad software connectivity (.NET examples, etc..)"
K001059590,If you can calibrate a pressure gauge but can't adjust it if its out of spec then its a bit pointless.....
K001052684,"In my experience, HP/Agilent/Keysight instruments were very reliable and capable, and the technical documentation is very good. However, I am still upset about the poor quality and intransparent licensing of BenchVue software."
K001058486,"If you purchase a large number of your company&#39;s measuring instruments, the support fee will increase. I would like to see a support fee for each company, regardless of the number of measuring instruments."
K001061672,Software updates are too slow
K001061493,Graphical Issues with the Pathwave Function Generator Software
K001052700,Very difficult to get a spare part for my DMM. I did send pics and details but seems to be very difficult for them to understand what I need. Pitty
K001051178,Responsiveness : Good & well done ; Quality service : Acceptable.   Cost :The calibration price is terribly high.  We are your regular loyal customer. Every year we send out our few testers for your calibration service. But the price is becoming higher and higher. No special discount or offer for repeated service yearly.
K001053168,The way to request from the homepage is unfriendly.
K001054771,"Your interface software is horrid, slow and buggy.  Frequent lock-ups and loss of data, not to mention the lost lab time."
K001051315,Tech Support was not knowledgeable  Tech Support took weeks to respond
K001052924,"According to a note in the package of DAQ970 software should be able to be downloaded. That's not longer true. We have to buy a licence on Keysight website, but could not be able to download it until we got an email with code almost one week later!"
K001056966,I had an issue with an instrument that keysight support was not able to fix
K001056773,Maintenance contract costs are high.
K001050154,The software is cumbersome to operate and prone to crashes
K001056156,"Last year, there were many price changes and the price did not match the initial budget. (I was surprised when I received an estimate that the license fee would be 1.5 times as much as the previous year if I were to continue using the software with a license.) The sales staff made alternative proposals and I was able to budget accordingly. If the license fees that are required to continue to increase even though the license fee has already been paid rise like this, I would like to refrain from purchasing equipment and licenses."
K001053624,"It depends on which device. I love the DMM 34465A. It's so versatile and I use it every day under different tasks. But the EDU36311 is a terrible power supply. It gets 0 points from me for this unit. At light load, the fan makes a horrible droning noise. I always make sure to turn it off when I'm not really using the unit and use a standard power supply for endurance tests. It also has a software bug that support has fortunately already fixed with beta software. However, official software has still not been released. The device has already been replaced once. It is a little quieter with the exchange unit, but still very annoying. If you think you can solve the problem, please contact me. Otherwise, I will wait until the end of the warranty period and then replace the fan with a better one."
K001007899,"Business and AE, Keysightcare service is very good, if there is any question, it will help to answer the question. The factory maintenance service is also good. The financial unit will take advantage of the position to delay or not provide the quotation to the customer."
K001009887,Powerful tool Not that easy to get up and running But good support from local FAE
K001016023,"The transmission of instrument problems is not smooth, and it is necessary to explain the problem repeatedly to the staff of different departments."
K001007200,"We are waiting for the Keysight benchvue to be compatible with Windows 11. Considering the licenses we bought, and that we cannot use it, it deserves a rating 1."
K001007916,"Just ask our sales rep, Brian Withnell"
K001011627,"Hello  we have ordered 3070 machine but the quality was to terrible seems like Monday machine. we had a lot of HW problems till today machine doesn't pass diagnostics as support team due to SW bug .  support team start warranty before we have got diagnostics pass what not acceptable!  Thanks a lot, Nahum"
K001016741,"These 5 points are for your business colleagues, and the other 5 points are deducted from the experience of one maintenance. When the oscilloscope is not connected to any DUT, the oscilloscope emits smoke by itself. After sending it for repair, it is out of warranty, so we just need to repair it. Although the business has proposed to send it to the United States for inspection, we still have to pay for the maintenance fee after the inspection. I can’t see your company treating me. The company made a statement on the safety issues in the factory. The inspection fee for this incident has been filled out in the system at the first time, but because your company&#39;s finances don&#39;t understand and don&#39;t care about our company&#39;s fee request process, they just came to recover the fee of less than 5,000 yuan, and there is no negotiation It is really uncomfortable to ask me to pay immediately, otherwise it will not be shipped to our company to ask for prestige, and there is no way for the business unit to coordinate in the middle. Follow-up survey reply, I really don&#39;t want to hear the official statement, so I don&#39;t agree with the link, thank you!!"
K001010006,"Long lead times, unstable prices and trade barriers"
K001003790,We purchased more than 30Nos  Signal Generator 8257D has CMOS battery issue. Our user not satisfied with it
K001007048,"I am from BMW Brilliance. I really admire Keysight’s feedback and problem-solving speed, which is very, very, very slow. It’s rubbish. I really hope not to cooperate again in the future."
K001013305,Last time it took 6 weeks just to get a quote. Ended up talking to a women from Keysight Colorado to push the people in Keysight Iowa to do there job.
K001011869,Most interactions are positive and solution-oriented but the lead-time between them is just too long and always warrants follow-ups from our side
K001009724,"When we were with Electroservices, service was great.  Since they were taken over by Keysight a lot of aspects are not to the same level!"
K001005098,Invoices are so difficult to get from Keysight. I always have to ask for them instead of them being emailed to me when the charge hits my credit card. The parts ordering site has become useless. I have to call in every order now because I can never get through checkout online.
K001015982,"Last service was too long to get RMA and get actual work done. S/W upgrade and Calibration literally took equipmenrt off line for almost 4 months. S/W had to be shipped to me, confirm I got it and hten wait for RMA to ship for install and cal. And original request was a month old before I was told the above process had to happen. End result unit came back with OOT report and our internal processes delayed release for another 2 weeks. Not cost or time efficient. Service is under review internally"
K001013096,A recent license purchase thru E14 was an absolute time wasting nightmare.
K001009643,Bad experience with nemo outdoor and analyze crashing. Bad experience with older handy and nemo devices.
K001014378,Ask for repair cost on my multimeter and was told they could not repair it and I would need to purchase a new unit. Later found out that I could buy spares to repair it. Later when I ordered the parts it took a month to deliver even though the quote stated a week. After I installed the parts found out that they were defective. Installed back my old parts back and my ohm range was hunting. The support team ask me to send it back for calibration with no promise that they could repair it. After that I was left with a meter worse of tha when I started with.
K001010861,ADS license files: No link to the license files on the web page while I was logged in and can see the contract.
K001009868,Bad salesman service
K001015527,"Even though the manual is hard to understand, the support is paid."
K001009480,Failure to share information with customers or being late.
K001008074,ADS is not user friendly. GENESYS has reported bugs that aren't being address by Keysight
K001012692,We were not timely informed when our order was delayed.
K001005287,"The service for non-business customers is absolutely terrible. You probably haven't even wondered how many people privately use 1000X, 2000X, 3000X series oscilloscopes and more (generators, spectrum analyzers) for their hobby, no matter if they are bought second-hand or new. People save a lot of money to buy your equipment and then they are left to fend for themselves - especially in terms of connectivity. If someone isn't a company, they won't have support for any product - that's weak. That's why I always try to tell my friends to think carefully - whether they want cheaper but good Chinese equipment, e.g. Rigol with the support of a local distributor or hi-end equipment from Keysight (which in my opinion is better in many categories than R&S or Tek), but no support after purchase because you are a private user. Personally, as a private person, I feel discriminated against. It's a good step that Keysight has introduced free basic versions of BENCHVUE. Unfortunately, I have to say that the prices of entry level of power supplies, oscilloscopes, generators are too high compared to the competition, which is not much worse - see RIGOL, SIGLENT, OWON..."
K001008888,"The software may look nice and approachable, but instead the user is sucked into a series of expensive licenses that don't even work properly."
K001010601,1. Technical IT issues with Licenses that were not sent on time; 2. Not quick reply nor smooth communication 3. Service performed not at usual standards
K001012803,Rebuilds are taking months to return or are not being completed at all.
K001015181,"Keysight really needs to lower its prices.  The people I know can't afford the extreme pricing.  Keysight could sell so much more if they were a considered OEM.  But apparently that ship has sailed.  So, the message is - lower the prices and start gaining a foot hold in our company.  I am looking at the equipment my company is buying New, and I do not see Keysight/Agilent in the OEM types on the test floors.    They would like more R&D - B1500A/B1505As, but as soon as Keysight sticker shocked the departments that need the testing performed, they decided to look elsewhere. I'm not on the negotiating team, but heres a tip: Sell us new B1505A with 2 or 3 HV/HA plugins and minimum-required accessories for under $60K. They would probably buy quite a few. What if they would buy 5 New and/or have 3 or 4 B1500As available for upgrade to B1505Aa?  Would a nice volume order bring it under $60K for new units and under $50 for conversions from B1500 to B1505?   Come talk to us and quit being so money hungry, makes your customers not feel appreciated and likened to a $ sign instead of a person.    When the 4073s start to wear out - I doubt they will go to 4080's - unless there is huge trade in 4073 for 4080 incentives. There are many other OEMs out there and this company seems to be going in a different direction away from Keysight.     Perhaps you need to reconsider $$$ and get some volume going."
K001016060,"I had a poor experience with an instrument sent to Keysight for calibration that was damaged by FedEx during its return to me. Keysight was the shipper and should have placed a damage claim with FedEx but did not. Thus, I was stuck with both a bill for calibration and repair when FedEx should have reimbursed Keysight for the repair. Maybe they did, but I never saw it. And, Keysight did not respond to my numerous requests to handle this in the proper way. As a result, I now consider other vendors for calibration AND new instruments."
K001003087,"Several reminders by email to finally reach you. After a visit from some of your colleagues, they offered to buy the equipment instead of testing it by you and give us a certificate compliance. So, a waste of time for us because it is not our order.  A big thank you to them because they recommended one of your collaborator ""Dekra"" and they didn't leave us in the lurch."
K001008570,In general Keysight products are overpriced.
K001011799,You have one five star employee in Nancy Richardson. If you had 300 Nancys working for your company you would be just fine. We are a government contractor who operates under an Approved Purchasing system and need help in justifying pricing. We also need help with terms and conditions and acknowledgements. We have been told that we must do things the way that Keysight wishes.

K001014143,I think it&#39;s customer service.
K001003637,"Performance is what I would recommend. Support is the problem. I was able to consult and improved a little. Problems 1. Tektronix&#39;s end of support is only for old devices that do not have any information left, but KEISIGHT&#39;s support cannot be extended, and it will be AS-IS. The more expensive the device is and the more you want to use it for a long time, the more fearful the end of support will be, and the less likely you are to recommend it. It has been improved as shown in the second line. 2. There is little information on the web about the problem. There is little information on the web for self-solving, and you will have to rely on support."

K001016299,There was a problem with the software. I contacted the engineer in charge of the Northeast region. The engineer said that he had no solution. He disagreed with WeChat and could not contact other engineers.
K001005049,"I joined a small company MACOM 2 months ago. I was shocking by the way KS handle this account. This is a very good customer for KS but may not have a deep pocket. The issue I saw is that KS does not help in some critical area such as SystemVue and generic testers which MACOM usually does not buy.   If KS wants to follow up call with me, please arrange VP/GM level to talk to me. Thanks!"

K001012186,"Bad communication, no call back although promised, same for email message. Unclear process and procedure. Pricing is too high for delivered service and solution.  Support on older products is too short for these expensive machines. should be 10-20 years."

K001014947,Amount of money
K001015821,"Parts. You do not sell them, except for some decorative plastic covers. When I needed a spring contact, you refused to sell it. Also, over the phone you mentioned the repair might be covered under warranty, but once you received the unit, you imposed a charge of $2935 for repair or $400 for analysis. And the Fault Details in your report are less informative than were my input comments when I shipped the unit to you. I said there is a physically missing spring contact in RF path, and your technical experts write the RF path is “blown likely due to electrical overstress”. This is a total lack of technical expertise. The only reason I for my rate of 2 is because you do have the parts and you can repair a unit, although at an astronomical price. I would consider your company as the very last resource in the universe. I got the impression that your company is profit-oriented, not customer-oriented. I will do my best to stay away from you and avoid dealing with your experts."
K001005205,"We have a problem with the licenses, which has been going on for over 3 months now."
K001013109,"Hardware tends to be good, but relatively expensive. Supporting software isn't great, and can be hard to find drivers, sample VIs, etc. Documentation isn't always great or easy to find. Keysight's website wants my email before it will offer up a datasheet or a manual, not cool."
K001014976,Soaring costs
K001016709,"The neck is expensive. I can understand Keysightcare&#39;s policy, but I don&#39;t think the price of the main unit is high, and the service is also expensive. Even if it is welcomed by large companies, I think that small and medium-sized companies will surely suffer."

K000956551,Slowest service on the world.
K000961271,really disappointed with a recent inquiry. Response was slow and drawn out only to eventually refer me to their forums for an answer which was really a pretty simple answer. We buy so much equipment from you guys I was frankly shocked to get that response.
K000967880,"I have reached out to Keysight for technical assistance several times in the past 3 years for information that applies to all instruments of certain model numbers. Each time I get asked what my ""Keysight Care"" account number is. Whatever paradigm shifts you have decided to embrace you have surely managed to ruin the reputation of a once great company."

Keysight ""lost"" the LTE battle to Rhode, and now that you ""won"" the 5G battle, you are taking full advantage of your lead (which will dwindle, and eventually be over come by your competitors). Licenses have become a huge revenue boost with rediculous pricing, and new policies that ensure we have to keep buying them. We customers will not forget, and will jump to other vendors ASAP.

K000969671,After sales service is terrible
K000965965,Price are generally very high for Keysight.  Very rigid and non-negotiable kind of attitude of the company. Not sustainable to place large repeat orders.
K000961593,The quality and stability of Keysight instruments are far from the era of Agilent. bad experience
K000965791,Time between responses and receiving responses could be significantly improved.  There is a support/case portal and customer responses or comments in technical cases or support cases are rarely answered on the portal. Why have the support portal if it is unsupported? Separate emails must be sent in order to receive responses.
K000966750,"While Keysight employees are always very willing to help you, in general the prices of HW and SW is extremely high and their FAE technical support (mostly in the area of ADS Pathwave Technical Support) mostly transfers issues to another group and then solutions are never forthcoming.  The value equation for Keysight SW in particular is not very high."

K000956380,"You allow purchasing of components/parts but neglect to inform the customer they need specific software in order to complete the repair and then once getting the software, it mandates that you have to use Keysight equipment only."
K000958694,"The company has a good brand and excellent product performance. The price is a bit expensive for mass production testing of highly competitive semiconductors, and the price/performance ratio is not very attractive."
K000962291,"Costs are excessive, while at the same time turn around is remarkably slow. Further, the system of pre-paid agreements is terribly inconsistent, with Keysight sometimes invoicing immediately, while other times not invoicing until a service is provided under the agreement. It's just a mess to deal with, and I try not to whenever I can.  At least your people are nice, even if they are shackled by terrible systems."
K000965000,"I had to keep chasing up the contact to get a finalised quote, and one of the quotes still has not been delivered."
K000968827,You've turned the world's most legendary brand of reliable test instruments into disposable garbage.
K000957371,Having to pay for Keysight Care seems utterly ridiculous. I would never suggest anyone to buy anything from keysight till you get rid of the obvious money grab that keysight care is.
K000964385,"Normally, I would rate as 10. The last 2 times I have used the calibration services, the timing after units were received was around 2 months with little to no communication. The most current time, we requested an update on the status of 3 pcs of equipment in calibration and no one replied or contacted in any way on the current status. This was after having the equipment for over a month.  Normally, once received, it takes about two weeks. I understand companies having employee resource problems, but communications need to be kept about our equipment."
K000968552,"Duplicitous behavior.  Management from Keysight comes into meetings at Verizon and assures us they take Wi-Fi testing seriously, and will be supporting the VeriWave product line.  However, product features and performance, and recent statements by Keysight sales organization prove that this prior claim was not the truth."
K000962344,Procurement is too laborious and the cycle is quite long.

K000962448,"Ignoring our budget timing, raising the maintenance cost."
K000959773,"I am a little worried about purchasing a measuring instrument. It is related to Keysight Care. Considering the maintenance cost after 5 years, we think that other companies&#39; products are better."
K000965255,"The delivery time is long, or the delivery will be delayed just before or after it has passed. The portal site is poor and unreliable."
K000964877,"・I think it is important to propose products/solutions that match user needs.・Especially for high-frequency measurement, after-sales service is important, and I feel that Keysight Care is an obstacle.・Recently, Keysight users have asked us about the performance, functions, after-sales service, etc. of other companies&#39; high-frequency measuring instruments.・Regarding VNA measurement, I feel that E-CAL is one of the reasons why researchers and developers are declining in quality (becoming measuring instrument operators).・We believe that round-robin testing and traceability are important for high-frequency measurement (especially millimeter waves) in the research and development field. It would be desirable to introduce such equipment."
K000960511,"I am satisfied with your product itself. The negative point is that there may not be a Japanese version of the detailed product description.

It seems that Keysight is inefficient in keeping the genuine status or records on the calibration & warranty activities under the contract. Upon asking for the data or records, Keysight service team keep on making amendment after amendment when question further.

I hope there are some room of improvement in this area."
K000922563,Customer service. I have been in Metrology for 30 years and have never met a Rep.  Sales sent me a quote. Then when i went to buy it. They said basically you can buy that. They didn't even try to help getting the right part number so i could buy it.   I am not trying to be negative but I just don't think you have name people say in the industry anymore.
K000923112,Ordering is now a mess with the split between resellers and direct purchase. Resellers don't have the concept of options to an instrument - and can't handle configured instrument bundles.

One supplier responded in approximately 5 hours, the second in 3 days. Keysight still had not responded in over two weeks."
K000924905,There is not customer support. Nobody answer questions either by e-mail or phone.

K000915219,"The device was sent back (via RS) due to manufacturing mistake in its screen. Keysight sent us the same Scope (serial number), with the same screen problem but with a new calibration form.  Really unprofessional behavior, not expected from a well known brand such as Keysight. The experience with your distributor RS was not great either, we ended up having to accept a new unit (but in this case without calibration) and pay a new calibration. It was the only option to meet pour commercial obligations."
K000924429,"The pricing structure for all the licenses, options, renewals, etc is an order of magnitude more complicated than any of your competitors.  Makes just getting a quote correct very difficult and time consuming."
K000917044,"I like Keysight equipment, but my recent support request  (Case ID 01207139)  has not been handled well. I have had no useful feedback.   I thought it was petty of Keysight not to provide the information I requested on another request (Case ID 01164772 - Release upgrade notes for obsolete 4285A).   The 4285A is obsolete, so I don’t see why Keysight should bother about a very small bit of information. The PNA-X is a very expensive supported item, but my request has been pretty much ignored.   Keysight did donate a CPU & hard didk to my customer at Bradford University, which was very generous. But the lack of recent firmware on your website is inexcusable."

K000922245,Faster response for compliance documentation.
K000924069,"Really poor technical support. It's very hard to get in touch with engineers, and then we get condescending and incorrect answers to questions. Keysight technical support is the worst by far of any company I've ever worked with. The equipment itself is good though."
K000926026,Expensive
K000917440,"Unfortunately, our Keysight Care coverage expired so we were not able to get a response to our question, so that's a big negative. However, we were able to use the User's Forum and get a response from Dr. Dunsmore. However, while he pretty much confirmed what we are seeing, it does not sound like Keysight will be fixing what we believe to be a bug in the analyzer firmware."
K000925841,THere are Datalogger for thermocouples (Typ-K) which are easier to handle like CSM-mini-modul. For my use case the csm can by directly connected to CAN where I'm using INCA and have all data in one measurement file. Also the measurement ratio of CSM with 100ms is much mor faster than using the keysight which is getting slower the more channels will be used.  Please consider this answer is only for my usecase. I'm sure there are other usecases for wich the keysight might be better.
K000918414,Support for older products (ScineLab) are improvable. Support for SW/communication with controller was not good at all.
K000915102,The calibration and repair time is too long
K000928284,"In the past, it was the immovable measurement equipment No. 1, but when comparing today&#39;s Rohde equipment and Keysight equipment, we feel that Keysight equipment is not as good as before. Rather than being as bad as before, Rode&#39;s equipment has become so superior."
K000924598,Keysight instruments are very good. However some of the systems are very old. For instance the 3070 is a platform from 1990. It is hard to  perform maintenance on the hardware and the BTI platform looks and feels like it was created in a high school Java class. The competition is much more robust and user friendly. I encourage Keysight to get some modern software people to understand this platform then create a new environment from scratch and not band-aid over the top of bt-basic.
K000917355,"1. no specific details for repair done on equipment.

K000922276,Equipment is good but the support system is terrible. Loose the computer and install a person.
K000918459,From June until now (December 2022) I'm busy updating the firmware of a FieldFox. The information that I receive is not consistent and every new contact person tells me another story. At this moment I'm waiting for the firmware. It's not possible to download older firmware from the Keysight Website.
K000925840,Very long time to get quote
K000925140,Lack of support and understanding of existing/legacy products (Ixia Hawkeye).
K000924393,Sometimes the support was not at high level as expected
K000927723,Once you made the deal you forgot about us. Your only concern is profits.
K000914188,Product performance
K000926841,"I think the sales person was good. In terms of the price of the product, I thought it would be difficult to use the successor machine in-house because of the company&#39;s integration process, such as lab integration in APAC in other countries, so I gave it a 5. If I had been able to secure a little more time in the lab, and had a lot of interaction with your company&#39;s engineers, I think I would have gotten a 7 or 8 rating."
K000926930,It means that there are times when it is good and sometimes it is not good to have some salespeople who are technically supportive and others who are not.
K000925060,"If there is an update regarding support information, etc., you can contact us."
K000927287,"While selling expensive equipment, support is provided for a fee."
K000926842,"We are having trouble with some devices and software, and we have asked them to investigate the cause, but there is no sign of a solution."
K000922068,Follow up on technical inquiries
K000922977,Because the response of the sales person is not very good unless a large amount of money is involved. I think the device is easy to use.
K000926262,"There was a case where the explanation of the need for repair was not clear when a problem occurred during the previous questionnaire + proofreading. I would like to see the risks of not doing repairs clearly stated. Also, even if it is a fixed-price repair, I would like you to explain the assumed cause and assumed measures in advance."
K000926154,Can you answer questions about the product
K000918972,Technical support for measuring instruments has deteriorated.
K000920982,quick response
K000923248,"Although it is the same for any manufacturer, the response to inquiries by e-mail is slow."
K000923235,"The support system used to be great, but now it&#39;s paid."
K000920972,Timely and continuous technical service
K000920612,Scheduled by Keysight. Delayed communication slowness. Lack of planning for delivery schedule
K000928020,sincere correspondence
K000913621,"There was an omission of an order. Very slow to respond (estimate, etc.)."
K000918667,It is a little negative that you can not continue to respond to customer support questions
K000926635,Please come to our company to pick it up and deliver it to us.
K000926257,"Operability of trigger settings, ease of handling probes, etc."
K000926759,"Regarding past purchases (8 around 2014), I was asked if I had a Keysight Care agreement or not, and I could not get a satisfactory answer. As a device seller, shouldn&#39;t CS be about responding to questions from users about sold items? I feel very angry at the response that they can&#39;t even answer questions because they can&#39;t continue to pay expenses other than the cost of the equipment."
K000927667,"When considering how to use the purchased device after purchase, the user-friendliness deteriorated because consultation on the application method was charged."
K000922660,Uncertainty about support
K000923089,Repair costs too high Insufficient explanation to Keysight Care
K000924803,"You were very responsive to our inquiries via email. Thank you. However, if you can call and talk with the person in charge, you will recognize it as a more familiar manufacturer. Since we are a trading company, we cannot introduce our customers&#39; products unless we know the product. We are always looking for manufacturers who can carefully explain their products in conversation with the person in charge."
K000922017,Can not deliver
K000917380,"Keysight were supposed to contact me about a psu costing 25000€, but for some reason you didn't think it was important enough with the sale. I bought a competing brand.  Then i actually bought a few keysight handheld DMMs to the lab. Without question, they are the worst DMM i have ever used as they are slow as hell."
K000919300,I’ve used a lot of stand alone equipment over during my career. And it’s always been great. But now I’m using a usb rf power sensor and the benchvue suite is just a lot for someone only using a single device. There used to be stand alone software for the power sensors and this was great and also had faster polling.  And I’ve just personally not had a great experience with benchvue
K000917411,We have none solved problems with BenchVue and it is difficult to install it.
K000923297,"I have been using Keysight’s instruments for more than 10 years, and I feel that the quality of the products is declining. The new network instrument purchased less than 3 months ago occasionally crashes, the new spectrum analyzer purchased less than 3 months ago, the power switch fails, and the lower limit of the indicators and specifications It&#39;s only a hair&#39;s breadth away, and it&#39;s not as good as a second-hand mobile phone a few years ago."
K000922153,"Having only overseas support is pretty much a show stopper for me, especially when working on US based projects."
K000923663,"While the problem got sorted, it took a long time and I had no idea of what was happening.  The update notifications, have zero insight into what the problem is or how time it might take"
K000921712,"I am disappointed of the price strategy, the quality of your products, the EoL standard of high end devices incl. equipment like pricey probes and finally the results from your support. It‘s becoming more unlikely that we are going to equip our laboratories with Keysight and so develops my opinion about ADS, EMPro."
K000926163,Poor response. I request quotes and sometimes never hear back or it’s a month or so later.  By then I bought a Anritsu or R&S.
K000918435,"High calibration costs, service, poor software, tester break down after software update"
K000928019,"My technical questions never got the answers I expected before I signed up for support. After joining the support, I got quick and accurate answers."
K000926156,two defect in in two year not functioning calibration in networkanalyzer
K000918071,horrible response time and very limted feedback
K000926230,politeness of service
K000918655,"・The maintenance costs for RF simulators (ADS, EMPro, etc.) are high, and it is absolutely unacceptable to raise prices every six months. If the price is to be raised for the purpose of adding functions or improving performance, it should be collected from the companies that use those functions. In the past, I talked to the sales person in charge about this, but they said that there was nothing that could be done on the Japanese side.・Measuring instruments are similarly expensive compared to other companies. Other companies (Rohde &amp; Schwarz) have standard features, but Keysight adds a price for each additional option.・The homepage is heavy and hard to see. And it is difficult to reach the desired page. For example, can you quickly reach the EEsof knowledge center of ADS or EMPro from the home page? I found it, but I wonder if there is a link in such a place. It used to be light, and I could quickly reach the desired page."
K000916164,Convoluted system you have for sending items in for calibration
K000921378,"The service is poor and slow, and it is not convenient for customers to contact you"
K000914833,not resolved the problem. even though authorised dealer.
K000918486,"Your software does not work. Your demo software works better. Your support team could not resolve the problem even though I paid for the software. Very, very bad business practice - unprofessional. You've slipped very, very far from the days of Hewlett Packard and REAL customer support."
K000922113,The sales and after sales service was hopeless. Took several weeks or months to complete and no one knew what was going on.
K000921867,Customer requests are Not soved
K000922086,"Because there are few opportunities to exchange information through conversation. I often attend web seminars, but the content is a little difficult."
K000927818,No monetary details are given for repairs.
K000920775,"Post-sales support used to be the BEST in the industry. Now that you have gone to a subscription model, even signing up for this merely puts you in a queue in which the priority is not to resolve the issue but to clear the ticket. As stated by one of your employees to me ""This isn't the old HP!"""
